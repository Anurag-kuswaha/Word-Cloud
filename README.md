 # For this project, I am creating a "word cloud"(i.e. Image) from a text by writing a script in python using jupyter notebook.

**  This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting       or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate the image from the dictionary.

**  Now I will need to upload My input file here so that the script will be able to process it. To do the upload, I will need an uploader widget. Run the following cell to perform all the installs and imports for my word cloud script and uploader widget.

Writong  a function in the cell that iterates through the words in file_contents, removes punctuation, and counts the frequency of each word and words that do not contain all alphabets and boring words like "and" or "the". Then use it in the generate_from_frequencies function to generate the word cloud!
